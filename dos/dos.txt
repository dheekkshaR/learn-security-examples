- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Denial of servcie is when the service is overwhelmed which prevents people/legitimate users from using it.
CIA- Availability is affected.

Used try catch, sends 400 if there is any error, when you send regex or empty or naything the service is actually crashing instead of injection.
SO here we can repeatedly crash the server becasue of this, using insecure server.
Adding try catch handles error so server will not crash it will just show error instead, keeping server available.

Sanitation of entered id/data can be done additionally for security.
Add checks, use middleware, restrict num of requests (rate limiting) from a source etc. for a certain period of time.
Add captcha if really requests are being made in a larger load than expected, services like cloudflare.
