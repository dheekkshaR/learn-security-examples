Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

Info disclosure :
Insecure lets even regex strings pass, which just displays the user details of the 1st user in the data base where username!= empty.
You can access user details without any authentication. 
Secure.js makes use of only words/input of a certain type is allowed. username.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, ''); 
Sanitization of input is included which prevents regex or code additions which can execute and reveal info.

CIA: Confidentiality violated 

We can also: 
Remove unnecesary console.logs 
Use hashing while storing data in DB. Use encryption. 
Dont send password back as well only what is necessary for usage send to the app.
